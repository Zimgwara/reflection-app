        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: September 2, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Reflect-Dent App ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal data. By using our application, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</p>
        <p>The Reflect-Dent App is a technical reflection tool created by **[Your Name]**, an individual creator affiliated with a UK university.</p>

        <h3>1. Data We Collect</h3>
        <p>We collect and process the following types of data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identity Data:</strong> We use a third-party authentication service (Netlify Identity) to manage user accounts. This service provides us with your email address upon registration.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflection Content:</strong> The titles, text, and other content you input into your reflections. This is the core data of the application.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Content:</strong> Any feedback or comments you receive from a lecturer or other authorized user.</li>
            <li><strong>Uploaded Media:</strong> URLs to any images or videos you attach to your reflections. We do not store the media files themselves, only the links provided by the cloud service (Cloudinary).</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information related to your use of the app, such as login times, and device information for security and analytics purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Data</h3>
        <p>We use your data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide the Service:</strong> The primary use of your data is to save and retrieve your personal reflections, enabling you to document your technical work and receive feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>To Ensure Security:</strong> We use your user ID and authentication data to ensure that only you can access your reflections, as enforced by our database security rules.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> We may use aggregated, non-identifiable data to understand how the app is used and to improve its functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Data Responsibility and Patient Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>As a user of this application, you are responsible for adhering to all professional, ethical, and legal standards regarding patient confidentiality, including relevant UK dental legislation. **You must not use this app to store, share, or process any identifiable patient information, including but not limited to patient names, dates of birth, addresses, or clinical photographs where the patient is identifiable.**</p>
        <p>Any use of the app for storing patient data is a violation of these terms and is done at your own risk. The app is designed for technical reflections and does not have the necessary security accreditations for handling sensitive patient information.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
        <p>Your data is stored in a secure cloud database (Google Firestore) and a third-party authentication service (Netlify Identity).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Isolation:</strong> Your personal reflections are stored in a private collection within the database, accessible only by your unique user ID. This is guaranteed by our database security rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Data in Transit:</strong> All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using SSL/TLS.</li>
            <li><strong>Data at Rest:</strong> Your data is encrypted at rest by our service providers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal data, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h3>5. Your Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>As the creator of your content, you retain all intellectual property rights to your reflections, writing, and uploaded media. We do not claim any ownership over your content. The intellectual property for the app itself (the code and design) belongs to the creator, **[Your Name]**.</p>

        <h3>6. Your Rights</h3>
        <p>Under applicable data protection laws, you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> Request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
            <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> Request that we delete your personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where we rely on your consent to process data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at **[Your Email Address]**.</p>

        <h3>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Your continued use of the app after any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
